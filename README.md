At the end of every season, the website for the basketball league I am in wipes the scores, so I can't go back
and see how my team did a few years ago. This script downloads the data into a JSON file for later consumption.

Overall, the script is pretty parameterizable, so if you are also in a league that uses quickscores and have node
downloaded, you can use this for yourself.
